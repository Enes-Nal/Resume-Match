## Project Overview

Resume Match is a web application created to help job seekers better understand how well their resume aligns with a specific job description. Many strong candidates never reach the interview stage simply because their resumes are filtered out by automated systems. This project was built to address that problem by giving users clearer insight into how their resume content compares to what employers are actually looking for.

The idea was to keep the experience simple and focused. Instead of overwhelming users with complex metrics, Resume Match aims to provide practical feedback that can be immediately applied when tailoring a resume for a role.

## Why This Project Was Built

The motivation behind Resume Match comes from real job search frustration. Applicant Tracking Systems often scan resumes for relevance before a human ever sees them. Small differences in wording or missing keywords can significantly impact a candidate’s chances, even when they are qualified.

This project exists to help bridge that gap. By comparing a resume directly with a job description, users can better understand where their resume is strong and where it may be lacking. The goal is to make resume optimization more transparent and less guess-based.

## What the Application Does

Resume Match analyzes the relationship between a resume and a job description and provides insight into how closely they align. It helps identify important skills and terms found in the job description and highlights areas where the resume could be improved or expanded.

This allows users to refine their resume with intention rather than guesswork, increasing the likelihood that it performs well with both automated systems and human reviewers.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using a modern frontend stack chosen for reliability, performance, and maintainability.

React is used to build the interface and manage application state in a clear and modular way. TypeScript adds an extra layer of safety and clarity by enforcing strong typing throughout the codebase, making the application easier to scale and maintain. Vite was selected as the build tool because of its speed and efficient development workflow. Standard HTML and CSS are used to structure the layout and create a responsive, user-friendly design.

## Project Structure and Approach

The codebase is organized to keep logic, components, and utilities clearly separated. Reusable components handle the interface, while helper functions and services manage data processing. This structure makes it easy to add new features or improve existing ones without introducing unnecessary complexity.

The overall approach focuses on clarity, simplicity, and long-term usability rather than overengineering.
